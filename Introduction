Kafka is a publish subscribe messaging system. It is a distributed, partitioned and replicated commit log service.

-> Kafka maintains feeds of messages in categories called topics.
-> Processes that publish messages to a kafka topic are called producers.
-> Processes that subscribe to topics and read the message feed are called consumers.
-> Kafka is configured on a cluster of 1 or more servers where each one acts as a broker.
Communication between client and server (brokers) is using TCP protocol.

Topic:
A topic is a category or feed name to which messages are published. For each topic, kafka cluster maintains a 
partitioned log.
